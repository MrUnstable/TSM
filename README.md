## FEATURES TESTED WORKING:

- Groups
- Posting
- Canceling
- Search of item ID or group items

## FEATURES NOT WORKING:

## EDITS:
Removed a couple strings from enUS locale mentioning the TSM desktop app from TSM_AuctionDB as well as the text & banner about the TSM desktop app on the main configration window as it's not concerning us playing on a private server

I've spent quite a few hours on this already, feel free to mail any eventual gold donations to Lyneff(Felsong) in game :D
